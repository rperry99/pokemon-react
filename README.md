# Pokemon React App

The base project was adapted from [this project](youtube.com/watch?v=bqDFwWNTv4A) by [Smoljames](https://www.youtube.com/@Smoljames) on YouTube.

---

With the base app, you can:

- The pokemon will be saved to the cache, so that it doesn't overload the API.
- See a list of pokemon using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
- You can search for a pokemon.
  - Currently, the app only uses the first 20 pokemon from Bulbasaur - Raticate.
  - With every keystroke of the search, the list of pokemon will be filtered down based on your search term.
- You can click on a pokemon name to show a card of that pokemon.
  - The card will show the pokemon's name, stats, an image, and its type.
